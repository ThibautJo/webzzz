# Technologies used

Our project is created with React to learn more about this technology. We have chosen <span style="background-color:#FFFF001A;">Gatsby JS</span> as our React framework over NextJS because our website will be static and relatively simple.

<br/>

With GatsbyJS, <span style="background-color:#FFFF001A;">TSX (typescript React)</span> comes out of the box, we use this prefferably over JSX. This makes everything more type checked so we don't need the use of PropTypes.

For styling we went for a mix of <span style="background-color:#FFFF001A;">TailWindCSS and styled-components</span>. The reason behind is that both have their pro's and con's and in combination they cover everything we need.

<ins>TailwindCSS</ins> is handy for quickly styling elements and reducing the number of lines of code, but might create long lines of code whenever many classes are applied to an element. (This might be fixed with npm package classNames OR in combination with styled-components). The downside is the learning curve.

<ins>Styled-components</ins> is handy to to render elements with animations or to style elements which are more complex. We could also use styled components for it's built-in themeProvider, which means we can change colors, font-sizes, fonts... on the entire page within seconds (which can also be done in global styling).

<br/>

Preferably we would use TailWindCSS as much as possible because it scores better in performance (it's pure css).
